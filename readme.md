# React-Videos

A small React App that will help with the store of a Video inventory

## Getting Started

- Node version defined via .nvmrc

  - nvm use
  - nvm install
  - nvm exec
  - nvm run
  - nvm which

- Change directory to react-video-app
  - npm install
  - npm start

## Notes to Self

There are some pre-opionated approaches.

- Preference on ESlint over JSHint
- Defined some VSCode Extensions - I forgot why I add them and what - would rather the project reminds and sets it
- Use of .editorconfig to make things consistent across projects
